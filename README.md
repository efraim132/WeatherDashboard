# â›ˆ Weather Dashboard

This is a simple Weather Dashboard web application that allows users to enter a zip code to retrieve the current weather, including temperature and conditions like "Cloudy" or "Sunny." The project uses TypeScript, Axios for making API requests, and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features
- Users can enter a zip code to get real-time weather information.
- Displays temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit.
- Displays weather conditions (e.g., "Rainy," "Clear").
- Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern look.

## Technologies Used
- **TypeScript**: For writing type-safe JavaScript code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and modern UI styling.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API.
- **Node.js/Express** (optional): For proxy server setup to handle API calls securely.
